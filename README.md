## 🧠 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 🌐🛰️ Hybrid Rendering (ISR + Client-Side Fetching)
**The Challenge:** E-commerce sites need the speed of static pages for better performance and SEO, but "Stock Levels" change every second.

**The Solution:** Implemented a hybrid approach. While product descriptions and images are served via **ISR** for speed, the **Cart component** is dynamic client-side. which fetches the latest inventory data directly from the database on mount, ensuring users never interact with stale stock information.


### 🔗 Seamless Guest-to-User Cart Sync
**The Challenge:** Guest users were previously restricted or "blocked" from adding items to their cart without being logged in. This created friction in the user experience.

**The Solution:** Implemented a **Local Cart system** for guest users. This allows users to:
* **add, delete, and review items** directly in the cart without an account.
* **Seamless Data Synchronization:** Upon login or registration, the system automatically merges the local guest cart with the user's permanent database cart, ensuring no items are lost.

### ⚡ "Zero-Latency" Cart & Wishlist
**The Challenge:** Eliminating disruptive loading spinners during high-frequency user actions. The goal was to provide an "instant-feel" UI while ensuring data consistency between the client and the database.

**The Solution:** Leveraged **RTK Query Optimistic Updates** to achieve immediate UI feedback.
* **Instant Interaction:** UI reflects cart and wishlist changes (add/remove/update) immediately before the server response is received.
* **Background Sync:** Seamlessly handles database synchronization in the background to maintain data integrity.
* **Graceful Error Handling:** Implemented an automated rollback mechanism with toast notifications if a server action fails.
* **Smart Reconciliation:** Integrated real-time notifications to inform users if item quantities are automatically adjusted based on live stock changes.

### 📦 Intelligent Inventory Management
**The Challenge:** Preventing "over-selling" by ensuring cart quantities never exceed actual warehouse stock.

**The Solution:** Implemented stock validation system that runs during the cart retrieval process to ensure order fulfillment reliability.
* **Auto-Adjust:** If stock is low, the cart automatically lowers the item quantity and notifies the user
via UI message.
* **Separation:** Out-of-stock items are moved to an "Unavailable" section.
* **Secure Checkout:** Disables the checkout button until the user removes unavailable items.
